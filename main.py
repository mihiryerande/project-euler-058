# Problem 58:
#     Spiral Primes
#
# Description:
#     Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.
#
#         [37] 36  35  34  33  32 [31]
#          38 [17] 16  15  14 [13] 30
#          39  18  [5]  4  [3] 12  29
#          40  19   6   1   2  11  28
#          41  20  [7]  8   9  10  27
#          42  21  22  23  24  25  26
#         [43] 44  45  46  47  48  49
#
#     It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal,
#       but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime;
#       that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.
#
#     If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above,
#       a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed.
#     If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral
#       for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?
